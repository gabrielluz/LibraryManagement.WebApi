[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/gabrielluz/LibraryManagement.WebApi.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/gabrielluz/LibraryManagement.WebApi)

This repository was created to develop a POC (Proof of Concept).

The software is being developed, it's a stock manager to control the rentals of my team's books.

Since we needed to control our rentals somehow, I decided to develop a simple software using AWS stack for learning/practicing my full-stack developer skills: from front-end to back-end and database.

The stack of the project is basically:
- Database: Amazon RDS Mysql;
- Back end: .NET Core Web API;
- Front end: TDB.
